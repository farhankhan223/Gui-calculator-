This code is a simple calculator implemented using the Tkinter library in Python. It defines functions to handle digit input, operator input, clearing the display, and calculating results. The graphical user interface (GUI) consists of buttons for digits (0-9), arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), a clear button (C), and an equals button (=). The result is displayed at the top, and the layout is organized in rows.
